### Common Structures
 - [Group] := operation with closure, associativity, identity, inverses
 - [Ring] := two operations, * and + such that: + is an abelian group, * is a monoid, * distributes over +
 - [Field] := two operations, * and + such that: both are abelian groups (+ exlcudes the identity of * however) and * distributes over +
 - [Module] := a ring R and an abelian group M such that: R and M distribute over each other
